### User stories

1. **Games feature**
   As a sport enthusiastic I want to be able to see which matches are happening on a specific day,
   I would also like to filter the based on the state (Finished, Live, Scheduled, ...) so I can plan what and when to watch.

2. **Rosters feature**
   As a volleyball coach I wish to create different rosters for my team so I can prepare different tactics for matches.

3. **Exercises feature**
   As a volleyball player I would like to have a list of exercises I could do alone or with someone, and filter them
   based on difficulty, so I can get better at the game.
